        ### Introduction

        We take the documentation serious. It is important that we support our community with the necessary information and the maintainers give a lot of freedom to the contributors to explain themselves. This sometimes causes missunderstandigs or lacks of informationen that needs to be corrected.

        However please do not report some small things like a missing dot or a little missspelling as long as it does not disturb it to much I hope you understand this.

        ‼️ This is the most important part of the report ‼️
        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
