        ### Introduction

        We take the documentation serious. It is important that we support our community with the necessary information and the maintainers give a lot of freedom to the contributors to explain themselves. This sometimes causes missunderstandigs or lacks of informationen that needs to be corrected.

        However please do not report some small things like a missing dot or a little missspelling as long as it does not disturbing you too much. Thank you for your understanding!
