        ## Introduction

        Code optimizations are welcome. But take a moment to [find out
        whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project](./../discussions/categories/ideas).

        It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's
        developers of the merits of this optimization.

        We also recommend to avoid any personal details you don't want to share
        with others within issues - others can read these information too.

        Thank you!
