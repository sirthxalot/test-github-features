        A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è If you think that you have found a security issue, don't use the issue tracker and don't publish it publicly. Read our [security advisory](../SECURITY.md) instead.

        ‚ö†Ô∏èThis is the most important part of the report ‚ö†Ô∏è
        Without a way to easily reproduce your issue, there is little chance we will be able to help you and work on a fix.
        Please, take the time to show us some code and/or config that is needed for others to reproduce the problem easily.
