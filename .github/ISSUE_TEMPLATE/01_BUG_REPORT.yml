        Both bugs and patches are demonstrable problem that are caused by the code in the repository. This may produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Furthermore this may also affect your system from minimal hickups to critical errors where the system may totally shut down.

        Bugfixes will be done infrequent and may not be fixed until the next major release. They usually don't have a bad impact or can be fixed by a workaround for the moment.

        Patches on the other hand need do be fixed as soon as possible. These "bugs" causes big troubles and may have no workaround.
